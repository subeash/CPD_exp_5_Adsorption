## Procedure

Please follow these steps to do the real experiment.

#### Equipment and Materials:
- Adsorbent material (e.g., activated carbon, silica gel)
- Adsorbate solution (the solution to be adsorbed)
- Glass columns or containers
- Measuring cylinders or pipettes
- Stirring apparatus
- pH meter (if applicable)
- Analytical instruments for measuring adsorbate concentration (e.g., spectrophotometer)
- Stopwatch or timer
- Safety goggles and gloves

#### Adsorbent Preparation:

-If using solid adsorbent material, prepare it according to the specific requirements. This may involve washing, drying, and grinding the adsorbent to a suitable particle size.<br>
-If using activated carbon, it may need to be activated or pre-treated before use. Follow the manufacturer's instructions or any specific protocols.<br>
### 2.2 Material Balance
The law of conservation of mass leads to what is called a mass or a material balance.<br>
Mass In = Mass Out + Mass Stored Raw Materials = Products + Wastes + Stored Materials.<br>

### Setup:
-Set up the glass columns or containers for adsorption. Ensure they are clean and free from any contaminants.<br>
-If using a column setup, place a filter paper or glass wool at the bottom to prevent the adsorbent from escaping.<br>
-Add a layer of adsorbent material to the column, ensuring it is packed uniformly.<br>
-Connect a suitable stirring apparatus if necessary.<br>
### Adsorption Experiment:
-Measure and record the initial concentration of the adsorbate solution.<br>
-Fill the column or container with the adsorbate solution, ensuring the adsorbent is fully submerged.<br>
-If using a stirring apparatus, set the stirring speed to ensure good mixing between the adsorbent and solution.<br>
-Allow the adsorption to proceed for a predetermined time, which can vary based on the specific experiment and kinetics of adsorption.<br>
-At regular intervals, take samples from the column or container and measure the adsorbate concentration.<br>
-If necessary, monitor and record other parameters such as pH, temperature, or any other relevant variables.<br>
-Repeat the experiment with different concentrations of adsorbate or varying contact times, if desired.<br>
### Post-Experiment:
-Analyze the collected data, including the adsorbate concentrations at different time intervals.<br>
-Calculate the adsorption capacity or efficiency based on the measured parameters.<br>
-Plot adsorbate concentration versus time or other relevant graphs to visualize the adsorption behavior.<br>
-Draw conclusions based on the results and compare them with your expectations or previous research.<br>
### Clean-up:
-Dispose of the used adsorbate solution and any remaining adsorbent material following proper disposal guidelines.<br>
-Clean the glass columns, containers, and other equipment thoroughly using appropriate cleaning agents.<br>
-Properly dispose of any waste materials, such as contaminated solutions or adsorbent samples, in accordance with your institution's guidelines.<br>
